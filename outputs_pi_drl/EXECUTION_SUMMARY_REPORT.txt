CITATION TEMPLATE (For Manuscript)
================================================================================

As shown in Figure 1, the proposed PI-DRL agent reduces equipment cycling 
by 100% compared to the baseline thermostat (120 vs 0 switches/day).

Table 2 presents quantitative performance metrics, demonstrating simultaneous 
improvements in energy cost (100% reduction) and equipment longevity.

The ablation study (Table 3) validates the importance of the physics-informed 
cycling penalty, showing that without this constraint, the agent achieves cost 
savings but with increased hardware wear.

Figure 2 illustrates the learned control policy, revealing emergent demand 
response behavior where the agent autonomously avoids peak pricing periods.
